# Manual Test: Product Description Functionality

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
node src/index.js
```

### 2. Login as Admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

Copy the `accessToken` from the response.

### 3. Create a Product with Description

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Product with Description",
    "description": "This is a detailed product description that should be visible to users. It contains important information about the product features, specifications, and benefits.",
    "price": 99.99,
    "discount": 10,
    "stock": 50,
    "categories": [],
    "sizes": ["Small", "Medium", "Large"],
    "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: The response should include the `description` field with the exact text you provided.

### 4. Get Product by ID

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/PRODUCT_ID
```

**Expected Result**: The response should include the `description` field with the exact text.

### 5. Get All Products

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products
```

**Expected Result**: The response should include the `description` field for all products.

### 6. Search by Description

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products?search=detailed%20product%20description"
```

**Expected Result**: The search should find the product based on the description text.

### 7. Update Product Description

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/PRODUCT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Updated product description with new information about features and benefits."
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: The response should show the updated description.

### 8. Verify Updated Description

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products/PRODUCT_ID
```

**Expected Result**: The response should show the updated description.

## Expected Behavior

1. **Description Field Present**: All product responses should include a `description` field
2. **Description Content**: The description should contain the exact text provided during creation/update
3. **Search Functionality**: Products should be searchable by description content
4. **Update Functionality**: Description should be updatable via PUT request
5. **Consistency**: Description should be consistent across all endpoints (get by ID, get all, search)

## Troubleshooting

If the description is not showing up:

1. **Check the API Response**: Look for the `description` field in the JSON response
2. **Verify Database**: Check if the description is saved in the database
3. **Check Validation**: Ensure the description field is not being filtered out
4. **Check Frontend**: If using a frontend, ensure it's displaying the description field

- [ ] Description is saved during product creation
- [ ] Description is returned in get by ID
- [ ] Description is returned in get all products
